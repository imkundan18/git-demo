    <p>In CRUD, PATCH is an HTTP method 
        that modifies resources by updating 
        specific fields. CRUD stands for "create,
         read, update, and delete", and PATCH is 
         similar to the "update" concept in CRUD.
          A PATCH request is a set of instructions
           that tells the system how to modify a resource. 
           The request</p>

           <p>What the error is actually saying is that the return
             value is missing the necessary implementation, not the 
             function itself
             (if you're a beginner like me it's not obvious from 
             the error message...)</p>
