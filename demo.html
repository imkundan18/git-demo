    <p>In CRUD, PATCH is an HTTP method 
        that modifies resources by updating 
        specific fields. CRUD stands for "create,
         read, update, and delete", and PATCH is 
         similar to the "update" concept in CRUD.
          A PATCH request is a set of instructions
           that tells the system how to modify a resource.
